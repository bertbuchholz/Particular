- Midpoint/Runge-Kutta
- Basic interaction, shooting in new molecules, pulling existing molecules
D - Larger molecules
- Control the LJ potential force
D - Molecule pulling: maybe increase the rotational damping for the pulled molecule? Right now too much wiggling during pull

- Controls FPS like (probably not, rather more automatic camera)
- Automatic camera, only zoom, facilitate interaction
- When zooming out, fade over to an iso surface (maybe fast metaballs over the molecules)

- Charge positions possibly adaptable in some region, to allow faster convergence to low energy state

- Cross section display, to make inherent structures be more visible (for example http://www.unc.edu/~perera/PAPERS/J_PHYS_CHEM_2002_1.pdf)
D - Also reduced view using stick model, see PDF above

- Show closest atom for each atom (outside its molecule) by connecting them with a stick, width or opacity representing the distance or force

- Store state

- FIX LJ potential to not only take into account the molecules center

D - Add renderers for different styles (ball, sticks etc.)

D - Store connections in molecules

- Check masses, distances etc. scaling, make sure they are relatively correct

Gaming part
- Have "black box" particles that can interact with other molecules, then generate energy (heat etc.)
